I am a Research Assistant in the [FDU-VIS Lab](https://fduvis.net), [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/) at Fudan University, under the supervision of [Prof. Siming Chen](http://simingchen.me). I will join the School of Data Science at Fudan University as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2026.

I earned my Master’s degree at Fudan University and my Bachelor’s degree at Beijing Jiaotong University. Previously, I worked on computer vision and medical image segmentation.

My current research interests focus on visual analytics, LLM-based multi-agent systems, and social simulation.

I am also a senior member of the Fudan Astronomy Society（复旦天文协会）, the Fudan Yutu Geographic Association（复旦舆图社）, and the Fudan Liberal Arts Society（复旦文理学社）.

If you are interested in me and my research, feel free to drop me an e-mail.
